=> SLUG: definition, use case, and applications | 
How to use Linear Algebra in various techniques specifically 
to solve use cases with respect to ML, DS, DL.

- Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of 
vectors, vector spaces (also called linear spaces), linear transformations, 
and systems of linear equations.
- It provides a framework for understanding the properties and operations of 
these mathematical objects, known as scalars, matrices, and vectors.

- Linear Algebra works well with higher-dimensional data.

=> Applications
1. Data Representation and Manipulation

Example: House Price Prediction

The input features and output features need to be represented in terms of 
vectors.

Due to vectors, we will be able to quantify the relationship between 
input (X) feature and output (Y) feature.
If quantity → 𝑌 = 𝑓(𝑋) then 𝑋↑ or vice versa.
If quantity → 𝑋 = 𝑓(𝑌) then 𝑌↑ or vice versa.

- When we say that it will be able to quantify, it means we will be thinking 
about the concepts of covariance and correlation.

(Important):
 - 1D, 2D diagrams: practice coding. : All files implemented

- Dimensionality reduction: Linear Algebra can convert 500 features 
into only 2 features. This is known as PCA (Principal Component Analysis). 
(What is the pattern data actually follows?)

2. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

- Model Train (practice coding of LR model train) — take patterns.

- Dimensionality Reduction → PCA → Eigenvalue and Eigenvector.

- Neural Networks: Forward propagation, Backward propagation

GPU cores → Matrix Multiplication (parallelly)
TensorFlow library to create a NN.

- For backward propagation: we update the weights using the chain rule 
of derivatives.

- For forward propagation: perform matrix multiplication and add a bias 
(so it’s an addition operation in MM).

3. Computer Graphics

- Linear Algebra is used to perform transformations such as scaling, 
rotation, and translation of objects in computer graphics.
