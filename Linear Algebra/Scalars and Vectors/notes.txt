=> SLUG: definition, examples, application in Data Science

=> Scalars:
A scalar is a single numerical value. It represents a magnitude or quantity and has no direction.

- Examples: Car speed: 45 km/hr,  Temperature in Celsius: T = 25°C

- Application in Data Science:
| f1 | f2 | f3 |
| -- | -- | -- |
|    |    |    |
|    |    |    |

::  Data set: Count of the total no. of records = 4
:: Average of the feature f = ___
:: Simple Linear Regression

=> Vector:
A vector is a numerical value which has both magnitude and direction.

- Example: Speed of car = 45 km/hr moving east.

- Data Science definition for Vector: A vector is an ordered list of numbers. It can represent a point in space or a quantity 
with both magnitude and direction.

- Example: Student marks
| ID  | No. of Study Hours | Pass/Fail |
| --- | ------------------ | --------- |
| 90  | 3 hrs              | Fail      |
| 100 | 3 hrs              | Pass      |
A vector representing ID and no. of study hours = [90, 3 hrs]
magnitude→ "3" and "hrs" → units

- If representing a vector in data science, it represents a collection of values.
- It can be in different dimensions.

- Example:
:: A vector representing a person’s weight over time = [70, 72, 75, 73] (4 dimensions).
:: Every point (data point in a dataset) is specifically represented in the form of a vector.
- Unit vector: 3i + 3j

=> Addition of Vectors
- SLUG: definition, examples, application in data science

- Addition of vectors is more like how you are traversing from one vector to the other vector.

- Applications:
1. Data Aggregation Task
2. Feature Engineering
3. Word Embeddings
4. Image Processing

=> Multiplication of Vectors
- SLUG: definition, application in data science

- 3 Types:
1. Dot Product (Inner Product)
2. Element-wise Multiplication
3. Scalar Multiplication

1. Dot Product
- The dot product of 2 vectors results in a scalar and is calculated as the sum of the products of their corresponding components.

-In order to project the product A*B we will go and see the length of projected B(bar)Then we will take this length and specifically 
multiply by vector length of A(bar)

i - If vectors are in opposite directions, the dot product value of vectors will be negative.
ii - If vector is pointing towards origin, the entire dot product will be 0.
iii - If vectors are in the same direction, the dot product will be positive.

- Application

1. Cosine Similarity
Definition: It is a measure used to determine how similar two vectors are. It calculates the cosine of the angle 
between two vectors, providing a similarity score that ranges from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar).

cosθ= A*B / ||A|| * ||B||
